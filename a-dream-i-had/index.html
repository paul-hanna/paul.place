<h1>A dream I had</h1>
<p><em>04.14.2025</em></p>
<p>Suggested listening: Leaving Dreaming - Ellen Akbro</p>

<p>I was standing on a rooftop—in front of me was the empire state building. There had been vertical and horizontal expansion on the empire state building, so weird blocky apartments that looked structurally unsound were being built right off of it.</p>

<p>I was there with my friend Max and a man who was explaining the rooftop that we were both on. There were walls that surrounded it, and the man who explained it to us said that the walls were perfectly designed so that when people looked down onto the rooftop from above all we could see were their eyes.</p>

<p>I turned around and pointed at a building, and remarked it was classic. It was gold-ish, with slightly greyed windows. Everyone in the building was sharply dressed as though they were Yuppie professionals from the 80s/90s.</p>

<p>Max and I then started to walk forward and found ourselves on a never-ending escalator. We wanted to go to the classic building to get something to eat, but found that the escalator we stepped on didn’t truly connect to that building.</p>

<p>It was some strange escalator independent of the building. Incredibly wide. It clipped through floors, and Max and I didn’t really know how or when to get off. We felt microscopic, that if we tried to get off, we’d fall and get hurt.</p>
